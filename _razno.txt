binary distribution sampling accuracy, required number of repeats to achive an 95% confidence interval of...
	//20000, 95% confidence that true value deviates less by 1%
	//5000,  95% confidence that true value deviates less by 2%
	//1200,  95% confidence that true value deviates less by 4%
	//750,   95% confidence that true value deviates less by 5% (default setting)
	//200,	 95% confidence that true value deviates less by 10%
	
	
//calculate the confidence, that two samples belong to different normal distributions

	sqrt(
		(sample2_num_repeats)
		* (sample1 - sample2) * (sample1 - sample2)
		/ (sample2 * (1-sample2) + 0.00001)	// + 0.00001 only to avoid division by 0
		/ 2.0 //optional
	);
